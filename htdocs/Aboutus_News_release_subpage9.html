					<h3><a>Affle unveils significant technology innovations to launch ‘Ripple’ – its rich media & video ad network</a></h3>
					<p>New Delhi, August 28, 2012: Affle, the leading international digital media company, today announced the launch of Ripple, its rich media and video advertising network. With the growing convergence of connected devices (PC, Mobile, Tablet & Smart TV), Ripple is an integrated ad network which offers cutting edge advertising solutions across all smart screens. Ripple is backed by some solid technology innovations built by Affle which enable it to deliver advertising contextual to the kind of video content being consumed thus making it significantly more engaging for users and valuable for advertisers and publishers.</p>

<p>Commenting on this launch Anuj Khanna Sohum, Founder and Chairman, Affle Group, said, “Three major consumer and technology trends are leading the digital revolution in developing markets – increased consumption of video and rich media over internet, greater penetration of mobile internet on smart devices, cheaper and faster access to connected wireless networks. Ripple is designed to leverage these significant trends with the aim to accelerate the digital revolution globally. Given our successful history and extensive experience, we have a comprehensive understanding of the needs of the consumers, publishers and advertisers. Our innovation on the Ripple platform enhances the consumer experience and engagement with rich media and that we believe will add significant value to all key stakeholders in the digital media ecosystem.”</p>

<p>Ripple differentiates itself significantly from other ad networks by having an integrated platform for delivering intelligent advertising across all smart screens and through its array of innovations which make advertising more contextual and richer in experience.</p>

<p>Commenting on the Ripple platform and partner traction, Anuj Kumar, Co-founder and CEO, Affle, said “We strongly believe that effective advertising is one which is engaging and relevant for consumers. Over the last one year we have been doing a lot of product level R&D and user research to create the Ripple platform such that advertising delivered through it will reach the most relevant consumer, on the most premium content and at the most relevant context across all smart screens. I am extremely happy that a lot of those efforts have made us build a solid product which has already attracted top partners like Samsung, P&G, Star, Business Standard, Dainik Bhaskar, Beoscope, Bolanews, Sambawa and many more across key Asian markets.”</p>

<p>A recent consumer research commissioned by Affle conducted by IMRB revealed that Online Video advertising is almost 3 times more likely to get users to search for the product vs. regular TV advertising and is 2.7 times more effective for enhancing purchase consideration vs. TV advertising. Affle has been very encouraged by these findings and believes that the overall user and usage growth in the video internet market coupled with greater ad effectiveness on this medium will help grow this market substantially in months to come.</p>

<p>Commenting on some key technology innovations on Ripple, Charles Yong, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Affle, said, “We have built some exciting innovations in Ripple like our new ad engagement unit ‘Storm’ which utilises image search, voice recognition, face detection like technologies to identify the most relevant context in the content, to help deliver the most meaningful advertising. Our tests on some of these innovations have been hugely successful and we have observed significant increases in user engagement levels through such formats versus the regular digital advertising formats. I am confident that once commercially available these would get a lot more advertisers and publishers to work with us. We are also working on a lot of other next generation innovations currently, as we strongly believe that a solid technology backbone for Ripple could help us significantly enhance digital advertising effectiveness and the overall market size.”</p>
